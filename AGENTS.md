- never fix lint error
- always fix type error
- core module need unit test, and do not test the third-party module
- esm module export is better than class
- test cases prefer using `toMatchInlineSnapshot` instead of `toContain`
- functions should not have circular references and should be relatively independent
- `typecheck` and `test` need to be run to make sure the changed code works
