- never fix lint error
- always fix type error
- core modules need unit test coverage, but avoid writing tests blindly—only cover essential modules, and tests should not verify logic from third-party libraries
- esm module export is better than class
- test cases prefer using `toMatchInlineSnapshot` instead of `toContain`
- functions should not have circular references and should be relatively independent
- `typecheck` and `test` need to be run to make sure the changed code works
